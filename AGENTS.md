# Experiment continuity

- The active project is the non-BTM V-JEPA 2.1 / MetaWorld campaign on branch
  `research/joint-flow-metaworld`. Follow `docs/FLOW_EXPERIMENT.md`.
- The user authorizes SSH to `target_server_2`, at most four GPUs total for this
  campaign, training, online W&B logging, and matched baseline evaluation.
- Keep `docs/PROGRESS.md` current. Record code changes, commands/configuration,
  tests, experiment findings (including negative results), run/checkpoint paths,
  W&B links, failures, and the concrete next step.
- Commit and push relevant additions, edits, progress reports, and compact
  experiment results to Git remote `origin` at each meaningful checkpoint and
  before ending a turn. Verify the remote commit. Never rely on chat history as
  the only record. If push fails, preserve a local commit and report the failure.
- Keep credentials, raw datasets, and large model binaries out of Git. Preserve
  them on the authorized server; record their paths and hashes in reports.
- Keep a running campaign's checkout/revision frozen. Publish later reports from
  a separate checkout; do not change the code beneath an active run.
- Use validation for development and selection; keep test results sealed until
  the registered models are trained. Report actual comparisons without assuming
  the proposed method wins. Method-family adaptations are not exact SOTA replicas.
